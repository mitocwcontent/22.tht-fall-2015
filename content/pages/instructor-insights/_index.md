Student Information

### Breakdown by Year

Most students were seniors. However, some were not, and this was a deviation from previous years. Some faculty members have decided that a student doesn’t need to be a senior to write a senior thesis. If the student has done high quality undergraduate research that’s original, well-documented, and conclusive, there’s no reason not to start the senior thesis process early.

### Breakdown by Major

Nuclear Science & Engineering majors
