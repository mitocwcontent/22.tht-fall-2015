Introduction to the Course
--------------------------

Welcome to 22.THT! This year, we are trying a rather different, more interactive type of seminar course. Instead of just leaving you to figure out what to do about your thesis prospectus and the thesis itself, we will guide you through various aspects of choosing, proposing, and executing your original thesis work. Therefore, this course will have more intermediate assignments compared to past years, in the hopes of lessening your workload near the end of the semester.

Major topics to be covered include:

*   Choosing a thesis topic
*   Planning out a reasonable amount of work for the spring semester
*   Setting concrete goals and milestones
*   More efficient tools for writing your thesis than Microsoft Word
*   Maintaining good communication with your thesis advisor
*   Finding and citing primary resources from literature

The learning goals for this course include:

*   How to choose a project topic, considering available time and resources
*   How to efficiently find and properly cite scientific resources
*   How to efficiently author a scientific document without doing any busy work
*   How to present your research in 30 seconds or less, in an impactful elevator pitch
*   Outlining a thesis in a detailed manner, to help guide both your research and writing
*   Improving the scientific content, richness, structure, and rhetoric of your writing
*   Developing your own personal, scientific writing style
