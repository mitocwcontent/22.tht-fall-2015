Useful Technical Writing Tools
------------------------------

*   [Beall's List of “potential, possible, or probable” predatory open-access publishers 2015](http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/)  
    Be wary of using journals on this list in your research. However, don't assume that mere presence on this list constitutes a disreputable journal. Beall's List is a self-maintained site, and there is some debate about its objectiveness and accuracy. See "[Beyond Beall’s List: Better understanding predatory publishers](http://crln.acrl.org/content/76/3/132.full)" and ["Ethics and Access 1: The Sad Case of Jeffrey Beall" (PDF)](http://citesandinsights.info/civ14i4.pdf) for critiques. A case of a publisher being added and later removed after protest is described in [Beall's own blog post](https://publons.com/blog/bealls-list-gone-but-not-lost/) and the [corresponding publisher's notice](http://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/534). Let's just say that you should consider your sources very carefully, and look for your own warning signs of low quality, predatory publishing practices, or something not sounding right.
*   [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/Download)  
    Use this graphical front-end to LaTeX as a happy compromise between Word's ease of use and LaTeX's robustness.

*   [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/)  
    A lightweight BiBTeX reference manager that integrates seamlessly with LaTeX and LyX.
*   [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)  
    A tool to organize and annotate PDFs and export citations.
*   [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
